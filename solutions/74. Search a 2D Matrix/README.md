# [74. Search a 2D Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix/description/)

## Description

You are given a 2D integer matrix `matrix` of size `m x n` that satisfies the following conditions:

Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The first number of each row is greater than the last number of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, determine whether it exists in the matrix. Return `true` if it is found, otherwise return `false`.

Your solution must run in **O(log(m * n))** time.


**Example 1:**
```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == matrix.length`
* `n == matrix[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `-10^4 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10^4`

## Solution


```java
```

```python
```

## Complexity

- Time complexity: $$O(log(m * n))$$
<!-- Add time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity: $$O(1)$$
<!-- Add space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->
